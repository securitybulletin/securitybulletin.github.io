**Top Story**: **North Korea** [tested a nuclear weapon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html) on Sunday. It was the Asian nation's sixth nuclear test, and by far its most powerful. North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. International experts agree that the blas was much more powerful than other weapon North Korea has tested to date, though they reported that there's [insufficient information to confirm](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/science/north-korea-bomb-test.html) North Korea's claim. Testing a thermonuclear device would represent a big step forward in the development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. **United States** President Donald Trump responded by warning that even a threat of using such a weapon agains the United States or its allies would be "met with a massive military response."
