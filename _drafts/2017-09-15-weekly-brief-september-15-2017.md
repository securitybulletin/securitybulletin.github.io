The government of **Bangladesh** called on Myanmar to take the refugees back, and Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali, the Bangladeshi foreign minister, has [accused the Myanmarese government of genocide](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/myanmar-crisis-textbook-ethnic-cleansing-170911081528888.html).

The International Crisis Group has also documented atrocities by the militant group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, and argues that there is [no military solution](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/rakhine-state-danger-myanmars-transition) to the crisis. Neither Myanmarese President Aung San Suu Kyi nor American [President Donald Trump](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/11/as-myanmar-cracks-down-on-rohingya-washington-asleep-at-the-switch/) have made statements about the violence.

The sanctions limit North Korea's oil imports to 2 million barrels per year and prohibit the country from exporting textiles, with the goal of preventing and discouraging its nuclear weapons program. The **United States** had [pushed for a complete ban on oil imports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/un-votes-new-north-korea-sanctions-stopping-short-of-oil-embargo) and for an international freeze on North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's assets, but America's ambassador the UN, Nikki Haley, nonetheless praised the sanctions as a tough statement that "the world will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea." In response to the sanctions, [North Korea resumed work at an underground nuclear testing site](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html) and promised to conintue building up its nuclear arsenal.

**Qatar** remains defiant in the face of the ongoing embargo imposed by **Saudi Arabia**, **Bahrain**, **Egypt**, and the **United Arab Emirates**.

The event marks an [increasingly entrenched division](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/100-days-of-the-big-gulf-feud-now-pick-sides) between Qatar and its allies and Saudi Arabia and its supporters.
