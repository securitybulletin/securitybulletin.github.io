## Americas

Mike Pompeo, director of the **United States** Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is taking an approach that may [jeopardize the agency's diversification](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/08/more-white-more-male-more-jesus-cia-employees-fear-pompeo-is-quietly-killing-the-agencys-diversity-mandate/). Pompeo's predecessor, John Brennan, implemented a number of policies to increase diversity among the agency's workforce. Some CIA insiders believe that reducing diversity will reduce the agency's effectiveness.

The violence in northwestern **Myanmar** continued. By Tuesday, the number of Rohingya refugees who had fled to Bangladesh [exceeded 370,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing--370000-rohingyas-flood-bangladesh-as-crisis-worsens/2017/09/12/24bf290e-8792-41e9-a769-c79d7326bed0_story.html). The government of **Bangladesh** called on Myanmar to take the refugees back, and Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali, the Bangladeshi foreign minister, has [accused the Myanmarese government of genocide](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/myanmar-crisis-textbook-ethnic-cleansing-170911081528888.html). Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the Myanmarese government was engaged in "a [textbook example of ethnic cleansing](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx)." The International Crisis Group has also documented atrocities by the militant group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, and argues that there is [no military solution](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/rakhine-state-danger-myanmars-transition) to the crisis. Neither Myanmarese President Aung San Suu Kyi nor American [President Donald Trump](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/11/as-myanmar-cracks-down-on-rohingya-washington-asleep-at-the-switch/) have made statements about the violence.

The UN Security Council on Monday imposed tough [new sanctions against **North Korea**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-the-push-for-oil-embargo-on-north-korea-china-is-reluctant-to-sign-off/2017/09/11/3a5b56fe-96e5-11e7-a527-3573bd073e02_story.html). The sanctions limit North Korea's oil imports to 2 million barrels per year and prohibit the country from exporting textiles, with the goal of preventing and discouraging its nuclear weapons program. The **United States** had [pushed for a complete ban on oil imports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/un-votes-new-north-korea-sanctions-stopping-short-of-oil-embargo) and for an international freeze on North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's assets, but America's ambassador the UN, Nikki Haley, nonetheless praised the sanctions as a tough statement that "the world will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea."

## Middle East

Human Rights Watch reports that the coalition led by **Saudi Arabia** has carried out five airstrikes in **Yemen** since June that [killed 39 civilians](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/yemen-coalition-airstrikes-deadly-children), including 26 children. The Saudi-led coalition [supports the government President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423) against Houthi rebels and their allies. The Houthis are a primarily Shi'a group that originated in northwestern Yemen during the 1990s.
