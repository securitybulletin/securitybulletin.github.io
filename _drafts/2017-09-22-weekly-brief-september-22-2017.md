**Top Story:** In an address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, American President Donald Trump said that, if forced to defend itself or its allies, the **United States** "will have [no choice but to totally destroy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/world/americas/united-nations-general-assembly.html) **North Korea**." Mr. Trump also referred to North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un as "Rocket Man" and said that Mr. Kim was on "a suicide Mission." Mr. Kim responded in a statement: "Action is the best option in treating the dotard who, hard of hearing, is uttering only what he wants to say. . . . I will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged U. S. dotard with fire."

The violence in **Myanmar** is spilling over into **Bangladesh**.

At least 412,000 Rohingya have now fled Myanmar, and many are housed in poorly-resourced makeshift camps just across the border in Bangladesh. The refugees tell stories of [soldiers and mobs burning villages](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya/rohingya-refugees-tell-of-new-violence-call-for-myanmar-sanctions-idUSKCN1BT08O), and Myanmar is restricting access by aid workers and reporters.

Europe
------
The **United Kingdom** made progress over the weekend into its investigation of an explosive device placed on a London subway last week. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. British authorities [arrested two men on Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/london-tube-bombing-suspects.html): a 21-year-old Syrian refugee and an 18-year- old Iraqi orphan.

A **British** man was [sentenced to four and a half years in prison for making Islamic State propaganda videos](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/sep/21/slough-man-taha-hussain-jailed-for-spreading-isis-propaganda) and posting them online. Taha Hussain, a friend of the leader of the London Bridge terror attack, filmed himself and another man driving around Windsor Castle shouting Islamic State slogans. He was convicted of seven counts of disseminating a terrorist publication.

Middle East
-----------
Last Friday, Houthi forces in **Yemen** shelled residential areas in Shab Al Doubba and Souk Al Samil, killing three children and seriously injuring nine others. The attack brough condemnation from the [International Committee  of the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/yemen-icrc-deplores-death-civilians-taiz) and [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/18/yemens-children-are-being-shelled-while-world-sits-back).

Cyber
-----
The popular PC maintenance software **CCleaner** was compromised by hackers so that one version of the software included a backdoor. The malicious version was installed on over 700,000 computers. The hackers appear to have been looking for computers belonging to certain tech firms, including Intel, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung as part of an [industrial espionage effort](https://www.wired.com/story/ccleaner-malware-targeted-tech-firms). The backdoor was active for 31 days before it was patched, and it involved [highly advanced techniques to avoid security software](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/09/ccleaner-malware-outbreak-is-much-worse-than-it-first-appeared/) and conceal its purpose.

On Thursday, an international group of cryptography experts, members of the International Organization of Standards (ISO), [rejected the **United States** National Security Agency's (NSA) preferred encryption standards](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-standards-insight/distrustful-u-s-allies-force-spy-agency-to-back-down-in-encryption-fight-idUSKCN1BW0GV). The NSA had proposed two data encryption methods to be worldwide standards, but the ISO feared the NSA had picked those techniques not because they were secure, but because the NSA knows how to break them.
