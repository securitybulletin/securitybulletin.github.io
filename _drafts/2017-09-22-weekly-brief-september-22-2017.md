Americas
--------
In an address to the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, American President Donald Trump said that, if forced to defend itself or its allies, the **United States** "will have [no choice but to totally destroy](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/world/americas/united-nations-general-assembly.html) **North Korea**." On Sunday, the American military had deployed 14 warplanes over the Korean Peninsula, along with **Japanese** and **South Korean** aircraft. The aircraft carried out a [simulated attack using live bombs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/09/18/u-s-jets-dropped-live-bombs-in-a-new-massive-show-of-force-aimed-at-north-korea/).

Asia
----
The violence in **Myanmar** is spilling over into **Bangladesh**. As Rohingya Muslim refugees fled violent attacks carried out by Buddhist militias and the Myanmarese government, thousands of Muslims in Bangladesh [marched to protest Myanmar's treatment of the Rohingya](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/bangladesh-restricts-rohingya-refugees-starts-immunization/2017/09/17/71a6eb02-9c24-11e7-b2a7-bc70b6f98089_story.html). At least 412,000 Rohingya have now fled Myanmar, and many are housed in poorly-resourced makeshift camps just across the border in Bangladesh. The refugees tell stories of [soldiers and mobs burning villages](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-rohingya/rohingya-refugees-tell-of-new-violence-call-for-myanmar-sanctions-idUSKCN1BT08O), and Myanmar is restricting access by aid workers and reporters. Myanmar's president, Aung San Suu Kyi skipped the meeting of the UN General Assembly this week. She made remarks on Tuesday, promising that Myanmar's security forces have been instructed to strictly adhere to their code of conduct and condmening "all human rights violations and violations of international law." She also cast doubt on the veracity of the Rohingya's stories, stating that there had been ["allegations and counter-allegations."](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/asia/aung-san-suu-kyi-speech-rohingya.html)

Europe
------
The **United Kingdom** made progress over the weekend into its investigation of an explosive device placed on a London subway last week. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack. British authorities [arrested two men on Saturday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/18/world/europe/london-tube-bombing-suspects.html): a 21-year-old Syrian refugee and an 18-year- old Iraqi orphan. On Sunday, Britain [lowered its terrorism threat level](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/17/world/europe/uk-london-subway-bombing.html) from "critical" to "severe."

Middle East
-----------
Last Friday, Houthi forces in **Yemen** shelled residential areas in Shab Al Doubba and Souk Al Samil, killing three children and seriously injuring nine others. The attack brough condemnation from the [International Committee  of the Red Cross](https://www.icrc.org/en/document/yemen-icrc-deplores-death-civilians-taiz) and [Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/18/yemens-children-are-being-shelled-while-world-sits-back).
