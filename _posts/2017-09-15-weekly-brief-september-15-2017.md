**Top Story:** The violence in northwestern **Myanmar** continued. By Tuesday, the number of Rohingya refugees who had fled to Bangladesh [exceeded 370,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/textbook-example-of-ethnic-cleansing--370000-rohingyas-flood-bangladesh-as-crisis-worsens/2017/09/12/24bf290e-8792-41e9-a769-c79d7326bed0_story.html). The government of **Bangladesh** called on Myanmar to take the refugees back, and Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali, the Bangladeshi foreign minister, has [accused the Myanmarese government of genocide](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/myanmar-crisis-textbook-ethnic-cleansing-170911081528888.html). Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, said that the Myanmarese government was engaged in "a [textbook example of ethnic cleansing](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/NewsEvents/Pages/DisplayNews.aspx)." The International Crisis Group has also documented atrocities by the militant group Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, which has [denied ties to terrorist organizations](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/arsa-group-denies-links-al-qaeda-isil-170914094048024.html), and argues that there is [no military solution](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-east-asia/myanmar/rakhine-state-danger-myanmars-transition) to the crisis. Neither Myanmarese President Aung San Suu Kyi nor American [President Donald Trump](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/11/as-myanmar-cracks-down-on-rohingya-washington-asleep-at-the-switch/) have made statements about the violence. Amnesty International has a [good explainer](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2017/09/who-are-the-rohingya-and-why-are-they-fleeing-myanmar), and the _New York Times_ has a [backgrounder](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/asia/myanmar-rohingya-muslim.html) as well. Ishaan Tharoor writes at the _Washington Post_ that America [should take tougher action](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/13/if-trump-wants-to-unravel-obamas-legacy-he-could-start-with-burma/) against Myanmar.

## Africa

**American** airstrikes in **Somalia** [killed six members of the militant group al-Shabab](http://www.bbc.com/news/live/world-africa-40829108) on Wednesday, according to U.S. Africa Command. The three airstrikes come after American President Donald Trump designated parts of Somalia as active war zones.

**Sudan** has [deported more than 100 **Eritrean** nationals](http://www.africanews.com/2017/09/14/sudan-s-mass-deportation-of-eritreans-un-deeply-concerned/) in the last few weeks. Most of the deportees were charged with illegally entering Sudan, but the UN High Commission on Refugees is concerned that many or all of them may have qualified for refugee status.

## Americas

Hurricane Irma may have spared the mainland **United States** its worst effects, but is still likely responsible for [$18 billion in insured losses](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article173182856.html). Irma devastated islands in the Caribbean while cutting a path towards the mainland, but it caused especially severe damage in the Virgin Islands. The United States Virigin Islands are [mostly without power](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/americans-u-s-virgin-islands-feel-forgotten-wake-irma/), and many homes still lack running water. Many homes lost their roofs in the hurricane, and [one of the greatest needs may temporary shelter](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/09/13/u-s-virgin-islands-getting-aid-but-still-reeling-irma/664140001/). Virgin Group founder Richard Branson, who owns a private island among the British Virgin Islands, [called for a recovery effort](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/09/11/richard-branson-decimated-caribbean-islands-need-a-marshall-plan-after-irma/) on the scale of the post-World War II Marshall Plan.

Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act, the **United States** law that permits warrantless electronic surveillance of non-United States persons located outside the United States, expires at the end of this year. On Monday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats authored a letter to Republicans and Democrats in Congress [urging them to reauthorize the law permanently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/congress/trump-wants-congress-to-reauthorize-surveillance-tool/2017/09/11/4fa33222-973d-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html). Lawfare has the [full text](https://www.lawfareblog.com/coats-and-sessions-call-reauthorization-fisa-title-vii-without-sunset).

Mike Pompeo, director of the **United States** Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), is taking an approach that may [jeopardize the agency's diversification](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/08/more-white-more-male-more-jesus-cia-employees-fear-pompeo-is-quietly-killing-the-agencys-diversity-mandate/). Pompeo's predecessor, John Brennan, implemented a number of policies to increase diversity among the agency's workforce. Some CIA insiders believe that reducing diversity will reduce the agency's effectiveness.

## Asia

On Friday, **North Korea** [launched a missile](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles/u-n-security-council-to-meet-after-north-korea-fires-another-missile-over-japan-idUSKCN1BP35B) that flew over the **Japanese** island of Hokkaido. The missile launch was likely a response to the latest round of sanctions imposed by the UN Security Council following North Korea's major nuclear weapons test last week. Though the missile's accuracy was questionable, experts indicated that its range meant it could possibly reach the **American** island of Guam, which North Korea has [threatened before](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/08/north-korea-guam/536952/). The UN Security Council set a meeting for later in the day to discuss the latest missile test.

The UN Security Council on Monday imposed tough [new sanctions against **North Korea**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/in-the-push-for-oil-embargo-on-north-korea-china-is-reluctant-to-sign-off/2017/09/11/3a5b56fe-96e5-11e7-a527-3573bd073e02_story.html). The sanctions limit North Korea's oil imports to 2 million barrels per year and prohibit the country from exporting textiles, with the goal of preventing and discouraging its nuclear weapons program. The **United States** had [pushed for a complete ban on oil imports](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-11/un-votes-new-north-korea-sanctions-stopping-short-of-oil-embargo) and for an international freeze on North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un's assets, but America's ambassador the UN, Nikki Haley, nonetheless praised the sanctions as a tough statement that "the world will never accept a nuclear-armed North Korea." In response to the sanctions, [North Korea resumed work at an underground nuclear testing site](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/world/asia/north-korea-nuclear-test.html) and promised to conintue building up its nuclear arsenal. On Thursday, Korean Central News Agency, North Korea's state media organization, issued a statement threatening to [sink Japan into the sea with nuclear weapons and to reduce the United States to "ashes and darkness](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/north-korea-threatens-japan-sanctions-170914075433009.html). Also on Thursday, **South Korean** President Moon Jae-in acknowledged a need to develop his country's military capabilities in response to the North Korean threat, though he [rejected ideas to develop or deploy nuclear weapons](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/14/asia/south-korea-moon-nuclear/index.html) in South Korea.

**Cambodia** denied the claims of 29 ethnic Montagnard **Vietnamese** claiming refugee status and has threatened to immediately deport them. The UN High Commission for Refugees says that the Montagnards are refugees with a well-founded fear of persecution if they return to Vietnam. The UNHCR offered to resettle the refugees in a third country, but [Cambdia has thus far refused to cooperate](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/national/breaking-cambodia-uncooperative-relocating-montagnard-asylum-seekers-says-un-envoy). Human Rights Watch [called upon Cambodia not to deport the refugees](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/cambodia-protect-montagnards-refugees).

## Europe

**American** troops joined a [multinational military exercise](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/us-troops-ukraine-nato/index.html) in the **Ukraine** on Monday. On Thursday, **Russia** and **Belarus** [launched their own war games called "Zapad,"](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/us-troops-ukraine-nato/index.html) meaning "West." Russia has issued assurances that the war games are defensive in nature, and the scenario for the simulation involves a separatist incursion into Belarus supported by three imaginary countries that NATO observers believe to be modeled after **Poland**, **Lithuania**, and **Latvia**. Russia has also claimed that no more than 12,700 troops will participate, but [NATO officials expect the actual number to be as high as 100,000](http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/peopleandpower/2017/09/estonia-bear-hunt-170914055839448.html). Simon Shuster writes in _Time_ that war games are an attempt on Russia's part to announce to the world that [its military is once again a force to be feared](http://time.com/4941045/russia-zapad-drills-nato/).

On Friday, a crude improvised explosive was [detonated on a London Underground train](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/world/europe/uk-london-underground-tube-explosion.html) in the **United Kingdom**. The explosion came at 8:20 a.m., during the morning commute hour, and at least 23 people were hospitalized with injuries. 

## Middle East

Human Rights Watch reports that the coalition led by **Saudi Arabia** has carried out five airstrikes in **Yemen** since June that [killed 39 civilians](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/yemen-coalition-airstrikes-deadly-children), including 26 children. The Saudi-led coalition [supports the government President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29319423) against Houthi rebels and their allies. The Houthis are a primarily Shi'a group that originated in northwestern Yemen during the 1990s. On Wednesday, the **Netherlands** and **Canada** introduced a draft UN resolution to establish an [international commission of inquiry into war crimes](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-yemen-security-un/china-backs-u-n-call-for-justice-in-yemen-u-s-and-saudis-dont-idUKKCN1BO0ZL) in Yemen. **China** indicated that it supports the inquiry, but the **United States** and Saudi Arabia opposed the idea.

**Qatar** remains defiant in the face of the ongoing embargo imposed by **Saudi Arabia**, **Bahrain**, **Egypt**, and the **United Arab Emirates**. Last week, Qatar held opening ceremonies for its new $7.4 billion port and invited officials from **Iran**, **Kuwait**, and **Oman**. The event marks an [increasingly entrenched division](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-13/100-days-of-the-big-gulf-feud-now-pick-sides) between Qatar and its allies and Saudi Arabia and its supporters. The Saudi-led block [claims that Qatar supports terrorism, which Qatar denies](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41209610).

In an interview with CNN en Espanol on Wednesday, **Israeli** Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu urged signatories to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JPCOA) to reconsider their commitment to the agreement. He warned that **Iran** "will be able to [enrich uranium on an industrial scale](http://edition.cnn.com/2017/09/12/middleeast/netanyahu-exclusive-interview/index.html)" in 8 to 10 years. On Monday, Yukiya Amano, head of the International Atomic Energy Association, said that [Iran was abiding by the deal](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/nuclear-watchdog-defends-iran-agreement-170911155556386.html) and praised the verification regime put in place through the JCPOA as "robust."

A referendum on the independence of the Kurish region of Iraq is scheduled for September 25. On Monday, Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bekir Bozdag [pressed the head of Iraq's Kurdish region to cancel the vote](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/turkey-urges-iraqi-kurds-to-call-off-vote-on-independence/2017/09/11/15ca103a-9714-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html). On Tuesday, Iraq's Kurdish leader, Massoud Barzani, [promised to hold the vote](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-iraq-kurds/barzani-vows-to-press-on-with-kurdish-referendum-defying-iraq-parliament-idUKKCN1BN12G) despite opposition from Iraq's parliament.

On Tuesday, **Russia's** military reported that [the **Syrian** government has retaken 85 percent of the country](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/russia-says-syria-government-controls-85-percent-of-country/2017/09/12/d1fec9e0-9790-11e7-af6a-6555caaeb8dc_story.html) from rebel militant groups. Over the past few weeks, and with help from **Iranian** troops, Syria has routed Islamic State militants from the central Homs province, pushing them into Deir el-Zour province in the east. The **Lebanese** militant group Hezbollah, also an ally of the Syrian government, [declared victory](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-mideast-crisis-syria-hezbollah/hezbollah-declares-syria-victory-russia-says-much-of-country-won-back-idUKKCN1BN0YN) in the war on Tuesday.

## Cyber

**American** President Donald Trump followed the recommendation of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to [block an investment firm owned by the **Chinese** government from acquiring Lattice Semiconductor](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/09/trump-blocks-chinese-purchase-of-us-chipmaker-over-national-security/), due to national security concerns. Lattice makes field-programmable gate arrays and other programmable logic devices. The Treasury Department [issued a statement](https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/sm0157.aspx) citing that Lattice's intellectual property and the integrity of semiconductor supply chains and explaining that "the transaction poses a risk to the national security of the United States that cannot be resolved through mitigation."

The **United States Government** [banned the use of Kaspersky Labs software](https://www.engadget.com/2017/09/13/us-bans-kaspersky-software/) in all federal agencies. The [Department of Homeland Security says](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2017/09/13/dhs-statement-issuance-binding-operational-directive-17-01) that it is "concerned about the ties between certain Kaspersky officials and Russian intelligence and other government agencies, and requirements under Russian law that allow Russian intelligence agencies to request or compel assistance from Kaspersky and to intercept communications transiting Russian networks." Kaspersky [denied that it would ever cooperate with any government's cyberespionage efforts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-to-ban-use-of-kaspersky-software-in-federal-agencies-amid-concerns-of-russian-espionage/2017/09/13/36b717d0-989e-11e7-82e4-f1076f6d6152_story.html).
