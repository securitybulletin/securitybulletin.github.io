**Top Story**: **North Korea** [tested a nuclear weapon](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/world/asia/north-korea-tremor-possible-6th-nuclear-test.html) on Sunday. It was the Asian nation's sixth nuclear test, and by far its most most powerful. North Korea claimed it had successfully tested a hydrogen bomb. International experts agree that the blas was much more powerful than other weapon North Korea has tested to date, though they reported that there's [insufficient information to confirm](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/science/north-korea-bomb-test.html) North Korea's claim. Jeffrey Lewis has a column explaining the [technical details](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/09/04/welcome-to-the-thermonuclear-club-north-korea/). His take is that the weapon was probably thermonuclear, and the yield a few hundred megatons. Testing a thermonuclear device would represent a rapid step forward in the development of North Korea's nuclear arsenal. **United States** President Donald Trump responded by warning that even a threat of using such a weapon agains the United States or its allies would be "met with a massive military response." At a meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Monday, America's ambassador to the U.N., Nikki Haley, told the world that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is "[begging for war](http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/09/04/548461574/haley-north-korea-begging-for-war)." On Thursday, the final parts of a [Terminal High Altitude Area Defense](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/07/south-korea-deploys-missile-system-as-us-strengthens-north-korea-trade-threat) (THAAD) system&mdash;an American missile defense system&mdash;arrived at a military base in **South Korea** amidst protests.

## Americas

Facebook announced Wednesday that 470 fake accounts, likely run by Russia, [purchased around $100,000](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/facebook-accounts-from-russia-bought-ads-during-us-campaign/2017/09/06/55793266-9362-11e7-8482-8dc9a7af29f9_story.html) in advertisements related to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. U.S. Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) said Thursday the operation was just the "[tip of the iceberg](http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/warner-facebook-russia-hacking/index.html?sr=twCNNp090717warner-facebook-russia-hacking1112AMVODtop&CNNPolitics=Tw)" of social media election meddling and called for regulation of social media advertising and cooperation between state and federal officials on issues of election security. The _New York Times_ has an [excellent article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/russia-facebook-twitter-election.html) on Russia's use of fake social media accounts. Meanwhile, Donald Trump, Jr. [told congressional investigators](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/us/politics/trump-russia-investigation.html) that he met with a Russian lawyer in June 2016 to learn about Hillary Clinton's "fitness" to be president. Mr. Trump denied colluding with Russia's government during the campaing.

## Africa

Tens of thousands of people gathered in Lome, **Togo**, on Wednesday and Thursday to [call for the resignation](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41174005) of President Faure Gnassingbe. Gnassingbe has ruled the country since his father died in 2005; Gnassingbe's father, Gnassingbe Eyadema, ruled the country for 38 years. Togo's cabinet [drafted a bill](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/togo-protests_us_59b05298e4b0354e440f0686) imposing a two-term limit on the presidency, similar to one the senior Gnassingbe ignored, but the move failed to mollify the protesters.

Tundu Lissu, an opposition member of **Tanzania's** parliament, was [shot and seriously wounded](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/tanzania-opposition-mp-tundu-lissu-wounded-gunmen-170907131959935.html) by unknown attackers at his home in the country's administrative capital of Dodoma on Thursday. Amnesty International praised Lissu as "of Tanzania's most fearless and prominent politicians" and called for Tanzanian authorities to assure the world that the shooting was not politically motivated. President John Magufuli [ordered his security services to investigate](https://af.reuters.com/article/africaTech/idAFL8N1LO3UF).

## Asia

Rohingya refugees continue to flee violence in **Myanmar**. On Tuesday alone, [35,000 Rohingya crossed into **Bangladesh**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41158703). The Rohingya are a primarily Muslim ethnic minority. They claim that Rakhine Buddhist mobs are attacking them and razing their villages, though the Myanmarese military asserts that Rohingya militants are attacking Rohingya civilans. A BBC reporter in Rakhine [posted tweets from one of the villages](https://twitter.com/i/moments/905812298023018497) that was razed. The BBC has a [good explainer](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41082689) on the latest round of violence and [moving tales](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-41189748) from the refugees.

## Middle East

**Israeli** rockets [struck a military facility in **Syria**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/israeli-airstrikes-target-syrian-research-center-linked-to-chemical-weapons/2017/09/07/2230abda-93a5-11e7-b9bc-b2f7903bab0d_story.html) that had been linked to the production of chemical weapons on Thursday. A day earlier, U.N. human rights investigators had concluded that the [Syrian government was responsible](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-41173133) for a chemical weapons attack against a city held by rebels in April.

Approximately [300 Islamic State (IS) fighters](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/world/middleeast/isis-syria-convoy.html) and an additional 300 of their family members have been stranded in the **Syrian** desert for more than a week. The fighters and their families embarked in a convoy of buses, bound for Abu Kamal in Deir al-Zour Province, after brokering a safe-passage deal with the **Lebanese** militant organization Hezbollah. However, the **United States** does not acknowledge the legitimacy of the deal, and the convoy has stopped moving out of fear that it will be targeted by American airstrikes. The United States Central Command (CentCom) claims that it has [permitted food and water to reach the convoy](http://www.businessinsider.com/isis-convoy-stuck-iraq-syria-2017-9) and called on the Syrian government to evacuate civilians. The United States has not attacked the convoy, and six of the original 17 buses turned back to the city of Palmyra without incident.

## Cyber
Cybersecurity company Symantec reported Thursday that a group of cyber attackers known as "Dragonfly" is [targeting the European and North American energy sectors](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/dragonfly-western-energy-sector-targeted-sophisticated-attack-group), specifically in the **United States**, **Switzerland**, and **Turkey**. Symantec calls Dragonfly an "accomplished attack group" and cannot state definitively where the group is located or who is behind it.

Criminal hackers accessed files that included [sensitive personal information on 143 million Americans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/09/07/hackers-steal-personal-data-for-143-million-americans-from-credit-reporting-agency-equifax/) through a breach which began in May, according to the credit reporting agency Equifax. The data includes home addresses, birth dates, Social Security numbers, drivers license numbers, and credit dispute documents. Equifax has set up a website, [equifaxsecurity2017.com](https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/), to inform consumers about the breach and allow them to check whether their data may have been compromised. Equifax is also offering one year of credit monitoring and identity theft protection.
